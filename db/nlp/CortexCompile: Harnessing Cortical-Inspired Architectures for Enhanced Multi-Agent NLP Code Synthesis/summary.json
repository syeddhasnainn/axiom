{"abstract": "Current approaches to automated code generation often rely on monolithic models that lack real-time adaptability and scalability. This limitation is particularly evident in complex programming tasks that require dynamic adjustment and efficiency. The integration of neuroscience principles into Natural Language Processing (NLP) has the potential to revolutionize automated code generation. This paper presents CortexCompile, a novel modular system inspired by the specialized functions of the human brain's cortical regions. By emulating the distinct roles of the Prefrontal Cortex, Parietal Cortex, Temporal Lobe, and Motor Cortex, CortexCompile achieves significant advancements in scalability, efficiency, and adaptability compared to traditional monolithic models like GPT-4o.", "introduction": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of automated code generation. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, Codex, and others, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in translating natural language into executable code, making them powerful tools for software development. Despite these achievements, the deployment of such large monolithic models presents significant challenges, particularly concerning scalability, efficiency, and flexibility.", "future_direction": "The implications of this research extend far beyond the immediate scope of automated code generation, touching on broader trends in artificial intelligence and machine learning. CortexCompile's success in leveraging cortical specialization principles suggests a promising shift towards more modular, specialized AI systems. This approach could redefine the development of AI systems, moving away from the " ,"research_gap": "Despite its promising results, CortexCompile is not without its limitations. The current implementation has primarily been tested on game development tasks, which, while diverse, do not fully represent the wide array of challenges encountered in real-world software engineering. Future research should expand the scope of testing to include a broader range of programming tasks, such as data science workflows, real-time analytics, and systems programming, to validate CortexCompile's versatility and robustness.", "conclusion": "The development and rigorous evaluation of CortexCompile illustrate the potential of a modular, brain-inspired architecture in revolutionizing automated code generation. By adopting a design that mirrors the specialized functions of cortical regions within the human brain, CortexCompile has consistently outperformed traditional monolithic models like GPT-4o across a variety of complex coding tasks. The results from our experiments indicate that this approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also significantly improves the accuracy and usability of the generated code."}
