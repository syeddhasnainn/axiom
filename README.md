# PDF Research Paper Analyzer

This tool extracts key sections from research paper PDFs using AI-powered analysis.

## Current Features

- Extracts abstract, introduction, future direction, research gaps, and conclusion from PDFs
- Uses the Together API with Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo model for AI analysis
- Outputs structured data in JSON format
- Reads PDF metadata (title, author, creation date)
- Environment variable support for API keys

## Potential Future Features

1. Multi-PDF processing: Batch processing of multiple PDFs
2. Error handling: Robust error handling for PDF reading and API calls
3. Logging: Detailed logging of the extraction process
4. Command-line arguments: Allow specifying PDF file or query via CLI
5. Output saving: Save extracted JSON data to files
6. arXiv integration: Scrape and download PDFs from arXiv based on queries
7. Rate limiting: Implement delays between API calls
8. Progress tracking: Add progress bars for multi-file operations
9. Caching: Cache API responses to reduce redundant calls
10. Expanded sources: Support for academic paper repositories beyond arXiv
11. GUI: Simple graphical interface for non-technical users
12. Customizable extraction: Allow users to specify which sections to extract
